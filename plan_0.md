## Phase 2: Solana Integration MVP - Rock Paper Scissors Results

### Setup & Environment Validation
1. [x] Verify development environment
    - Run `anchor --version` to confirm installation
    - Run `solana --version` to confirm installation
    - Test local validator with `anchor test` using basic initialize
    - Confirm successful test execution

### Core Implementation
2. [x] Implement basic GameResult structure
    ```rust
    #[account]
    pub struct GameResult {
        pub player: Pubkey,            // 32
        pub result: GameOutcome,       // 1
        pub timestamp: i64,            // 8
    }

    #[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
    pub enum GameOutcome {
        Win,
        Loss,
        Draw,
    }
    ```
    - Write test to create and verify account structure
    - Run `anchor test` to validate

3. [ ] Implement record_game_result instruction
    - Add instruction to record game results
    - Create appropriate Context struct
    - Write test to record a sample game result
    - Run `anchor test` to validate

4. [ ] Create basic Zig interface
    ```zig
    pub const SolanaInterface = struct {
        pub fn recordGameResult(
            player: PublicKey,
            result: GameOutcome,
            timestamp: i64,
        ) Error!void;
    }
    ```
    - Write simple test from Zig to call Solana program
    - Validate transaction confirmation
    - Run combined test suite

### Integration Testing
5. [ ] End-to-end testing
    - Create test that simulates game completion
    - Verify result storage on Solana
    - Test error conditions and handling
    - Run full test suite

### Documentation & Cleanup
6. [ ] Document integration points
    - Document Solana program API
    - Document Zig interface usage
    - Add example usage

### Future Phases (Post-MVP)
7. [ ] Player Account System
    - Player registration
    - Authentication
    - Profile management

8. [ ] Enhanced Game Features
    - Game history tracking
    - Player statistics
    - Opponent tracking
    - Additional game types

Note: After each step, we'll run tests to ensure everything works as expected before moving to the next step. Each step should be committed separately for better tracking and potential rollback if needed.
